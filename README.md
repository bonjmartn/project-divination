# Project Divination

This is a side project that I did to learn React. I also used it as an opportunity to practice JavaScript, especially ES6, as well as CSS3 such as animations, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

I watched various tutorials then created this website on my own to integrate the concepts that I learned. This website contains a mixture of ideas from the tutorials and things I wrote from scratch.

## React

This project uses these React items:

- Create React App
- React components
- React props
- React state
- Parent and child components
- React lifecycle methods
- React Router
- Forms in React
- An NPM package for a "cookie consent" type of bar that asks users to accept the Terms of Use
- An NPM package for Google Analytics

The overall idea of most of the site is that something is chosen at random, either by generating a random number or selecting an object from an array, then that result is rendered on the page. Occasionally, a choice is gathered from the user via a form, and that is used to generate something on the page.

This is not a complicated use of React, but it suits the technology, so it's what I decided to do as a method to learn how React works.

## CSS

For this project, I chose not to use any CSS libraries because I wanted to write all of the CSS myself. This project includes these CSS items:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- A responsive navbar created with Flexbox and JavaScript
- CSS animations using transforms
- Responsive page layout
- CSS gradients, hovers, and manipulation of SVGs with both CSS and JavaScript

## Design

In addition to learning React, I also wanted to use this project as a web design portfolio item. I designed the website in Adobe XD, then coded it based on that design. 

I created all the graphic assets on the site, except for the Tarot cards, which are from a deck that's in the public domain. I also created a matching set of icons that's available on Adobe Stock.

- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Graphic design
- Web design
- Logo design
- Branding / style sheet

Below is the readme that comes with Create React App

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
