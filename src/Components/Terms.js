          <p>PRIVACY</p>

          <p>Project Divination appreciates and respects the privacy concerns of the visitors to its web site. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected by Project Divination from customers visiting this web site. However, certain information is recorded as a matter of course by Project Divination’s servers in order to track the number of visitors to the web site and to help provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor. The type of information tracked by our servers includes the browser and operating system in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor’s Internet service. Collecting this information allows Project Divination to optimize the visitor’s web site experience. Email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to Project Divination only if and when voluntarily submitted by the visitor. Any personal information collected by Project Divination is retained by Project Divination and not sold or otherwise provided to third parties. Project Divination sometimes uses email addresses and other personally identifiable information to communicate with visitors who have provided Project Divination with their email addresses for specific purposes such as receiving newsletters or other information. Each newsletter will also contain instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter.

Although cookies enable Project Divination to relate a visitor’s use of Project Divination’s site to information that the visitor has specifically and knowingly provided, Project Divination does not do so for any sites specifically designed for and aimed at children. Project Divination believes that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online any personal information without parental permission.</p>
